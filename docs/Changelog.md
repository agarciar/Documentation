# Changelog

Index of [RsyncOSX documentation](https://rsyncosx.github.io/Documentation/).

I am using the application on a daily basis and it evolves during my own use. Any suggestions for new _features_, _changed features_ and _bug reports_ are more than welcome.

Please add an [Issue](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/issues) regarding any requests or bugs.

## Version 4.4.x (macOS 10.13 (High Sierra), Xcode 9 and Swift 4)

RsyncOSX is converted to Swift 4.x (beta), compiled with Xcode 9 (beta) and tested on macOS 10.13 (beta released to developers). I have one MacBook Pro which is installed with latest developer beta of macOS 10.13 (High Sierra). An updated version of RsyncOSX will be released as soon as Apple releases macOS 10.13 and Xcode 9.   

## Version 4.3.5 release candidate

Probably a few more enhancements will be added before release. This rc is my daily driver.

* [Download rc](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/RsyncOSX/releases/download/v4.3.5rc/RsyncOSX.dmg)
* updated **7 June 2017**
	* compiled with Xcode 8.3.3 (which was released June 2017)
* Seems like the [logging](Logging.md) problem is partly solved in 30 May 2017 update
* Added Abort when real task is executing
* Refactor of Copy Single files/directory
	* in userconfig set temporary restore catalog (for single files or directory)
	* display size remote files
	* double click on row to get remote filelist
	* double click on row to restore files or directory to temporary (local) catalog
* Clean up of other parts of code

## Version 4.3.0

* released 8 May 2017
* assist in setup of [passwordless logins](PasswordlessLogin.md)
	* see [doc](ssh.md) - documentation in progress
* couple of bugfixes

## Version 4.2.5

**Bug** in version 4.2.5 causes RsyncOSX to crash if RsyncOSX is minimized during execution of a task. Bug is fixed and will be released in version 4.3.0.

**Next** release (version 4.3.0) will probably include some functionality for assisting setup of [passwordless logins](PasswordlessLogin.md). Don't know when it will be released. Summer is coming and further development of RsyncOSX will be slowed down during summer. I am currently working on this release now and (slowly) progressing...

* released 23 Apr 2017
* minor bugfixes and cleanup of code
* compiled with new release of Xcode (version 8.3.2)
* adjusted the parameters to rsync
* adjusted the schedule

![](screenshots/4.2.5/parameter.png)
![](screenshots/4.2.5/mainview.png)

In the parameter to rsync, if `backup` option is selected RsyncOSX adds the directory to the backup catalog (for saving changed and deleted files). Choose either suffix for FreeBSD or Linux. Neither of them works on **local backup** macOS (have to test more). But, if you copy and paste the FreeBSD suffix in a terminal window it works on macOS (it adds the correct timestamp to the changed files in the backup directory).

![](screenshots/4.2.5/schedule.png)

The schedule now informs if a scheduled backup plan is to short ahead. A weekly backup must be at least seven days ahead of current date and time.

## Version 4.2.0

* released 10 April 2017
* compiled with new release of Xcode (version 8.3.1)
* enhanced the batchwork part
* fixed a couple of minor bugs
* some cleanup in code
* reorganized Help
* there is an issue when RsyncOSX counts files to be transferred in *batchmode*, the issue does not introduce any faults (informal only)
* there is also an issue when RsyncOSX is logging, sometimes RsyncOSX does log 0 files and not the actual number of files and size of transfer (informal only)

![](screenshots/4.1.5rc/batch.png)

## Version 4.1.0

* released 19 March 2017
* fixed one bug in parameters to rsync (causing RsyncOSX to crash)
* new help function - opens relevant html page in browser
* added new info using rsync version 3.1.2 (number of *new* and *delete* files)
	* see [user configuration](UserConfiguration.md) how set other version of rsync

![](screenshots/4.1.0/new.png)


## Version 4.0.0

* released 8 March 2017
* new application icon by Forrest Walter (this is the primary reason why releasing a new version)
* added new functionality in `Copy files` - double click on source get list of files from remote server

![](screenshots/4.0.0/copy.png)


## Version 3.9.7

Sometimes rsync throws errors and does not execute as expected. Single task is implemented as queue of work (`estimate`, `execute` and `done`). If `estimate` or `execute` fails (by some reason) the user has to be made aware of situation and fix it.

RsyncOSX checks output from rsync for string *rsync error:*. If found main view is notified, error is marked (in red) and work queue is reset if option in userconfig (see below) is set. To test enter a not valid user name for a remote server ([edit task](SingleTask.md) in main view).

Other changes:

- released 2 March 2017
- some refactor and several cleanup of code
- Added reporting any file errors (in profile) to main view.
- There is also fixed a minor bug in Profiles.
- In About menu reference to GitHub Pages about Changelog and Documentation of RsyncOSX

See [releases](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/Version3.x/releases) for download.

## Version 3.9.5

Version 3.9.5 might **crash** for some user. This is due to localized string representation of dates in logs. RsyncOSX only accepts `en_US` format of dates in logs. Comparing and sorting other localized string representation of dates causes a crash.

If RsyncOSX crash during startup please delete the schedule and loggfile: `Documents/Rsync/MacID/scheduleRsync.plist` (deleting this file only deletes any schedule and logs).


- released 28 January 2017
- IÂ´m not adding any major new functionality to RsyncOSX, only minor enhancements.
- the focus in this release candidate is to make logs more informal and stable
- logs are now sorted with most recent log on top (first row in table)
- active schedules are marked red
	- number of logs in each schedule
	- manual execution of tasks are logged under start date `1 Jan 1900 00:00`
- dates are forced to "en_US" localization to prevent RsyncOSX from crashing if the preferred language of macOS is other than english (e.g. Norwegian)

## Version 3.8.6
After releasing this version I will not release new versions for some time. I have to focus on my new job (start 2 January 2017) for some time. I will continue to develop RsyncOSX in the future, but the number of new releases will drop compared to 2016.

- split `--backup` parameter and `--suffix` in parameter view
- refactor of code for rsync parameters and logging
- speed of sorting and filter logs improved

	- this will be the last release for some time (most likely last release this year)

- there is a bug in deleting ssh-port - **fixed**
- there is a bug in enabling Profiles menu when RsyncOSX is started on a Mac for the first time (Profiles menu is not enabled) - **fixed**

## Version 3.5.5

- new image updated **10 November 2016** : some minor GUI tweaks and automatic dismiss after 10 seconds in some of the views
- new image updated **5 November 2016** : if selecting new profile before background check for connection is completed RsyncOSX might crash, fix is done and new image is uploaded. Background check is executed when main view loads and remote servers not responding is marked red.
- released 3 November 2016
- fixed a couple of bugs in automatic dismiss of popup views (when scheduled backups are running and in main view a popup informs of backup)

- mainly a maintenance release, some bigger internal changes and some GUI tweaks
- RsyncOSX is more stable than ever
  - replaced states by work queue (using states get complex even with a few states)
  - I am learning Swift every day and [refactor code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) is important
- code ([master](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/Version3.x/tree/master)) at Github is updated with last commits
- added double click for executing single task and select profile
  - double click first time executes a dry run, another double click after dryrun executes the real task
