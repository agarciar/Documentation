# Changelog

Index of [RsyncOSX documentation](https://rsyncosx.github.io/Documentation/).

I am using the application on a daily basis and it evolves during my own use. Any suggestions for new _features_, _changed features_ and _bug reports_ are more than welcome. 

Please add an [Issue](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/Version3.x/issues) regarding any requests or bugs.

## Source code

The [code](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/Version3.x/tree/master) is **not** example of neither writing _decent Swift code_, _OO-development_ or _applying the MVC-pattern_. It all started as a project to learn the _basics_ about Swift and Xcode. And I am still learning, every day. I am not a professional developer, this is for fun only. Coding is an art and to be really good at coding requires years of experience. My experience of coding is far from that ;-) But I am happy to share the code with anyone interested. Sharing of code is in my opinion the best way to get quality.

## Version 4.2.0

* released 10 April 2017
* compiled with new release of Xcode (version 8.3.1)
* enhanced the batchwork part
* fixed a couple of minor bugs
* some cleanup in code
* reorganized Help
* there is an issue when RsyncOSX counts files to be transferred in *batchmode*, the issue does not introduce any faults (informal only)
* there is also an issue when RsyncOSX is logging, sometimes RsyncOSX does log 0 files and not the actual number of files and size of transfer (informal only)

## Version 4.1.0

* released 19 March 2017
* fixed one bug in parameters to rsync (causing RsyncOSX to crash)
* new help function - opens relevant html page in browser
* added new info using rsync version 3.1.2 (number of *new* and *delete* files)
	* see [user configuration](UserConfiguration.md) how set other version of rsync

## Version 4.0.0

## Version 3.9.7

Sometimes rsync throws errors and does not execute as expected. Single task is implemented as queue of work (`estimate`, `execute` and `done`). If `estimate` or `execute` failes (by some reason) the user has to be made aware of situation and fix it. 

RsyncOSX checks output from rsync for string *rsync error:*. If found main view is notfied, error is marked (in red) and work queue is reset if option in userconfig (see below) is set. To test enter a not valid user name for a remote server ([edit task](SingleTask.md) in main view).

Other changes:

- released 2 March 2017
- some refactor and several cleanup of code
- Added reporting any file errors (in profile) to main view. 
- There is also fixed a minor bug in Profiles.
- In About menu reference to GitHub Pages about Changelog and Documentation of RsyncOSX

See [releases](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/Version3.x/releases) for download.

## Version 3.9.5

Version 3.9.5 might **crash** for some user. This is due to localised string representation of dates in logs. RsyncOSX only accepts `en_US` format of dates in logs. Comparing and sorting other localised string representation of dates causes a crash.

If RsyncOSX crash during startup please delete the schedule and logfile: `Documents/Rsync/MacID/scheduleRsync.plist` (deleting this file only deletes any schedule and logs).


- released 28 January 2017
- IÂ´m not adding any major new functionality to RsyncOSX, only minor enhancements.
- the focus in this release candidate is to make logs more informal and stable
- logs are now sorted with most recent log on top (first row in table)
- active schedules are marked red
	- number of logs in each schedule
	- manual execution of tasks are logged under start date `1 Jan 1900 00:00`
- dates are forced to "en_US" localisation to prevent RsyncOSX from crashing if the preferred language of macOS is other than english (e.g. Norwegian)

## Version 3.8.6
After releasing this version I will not release new versions for some time. I have to focus on my new job (start 2 January 2017) for some time. I will continue to develop RsyncOSX in the future, but the number of new releases will drop compared to 2016.

- refactor of code for rsync parameters and logging

	- this will be the last release for some time (most likly last release this year)

- there is a bug in enabling Profiles menu when RsyncOSX is started on a Mac for the first time (Profiles menu is not enabled) - **fixed**

  - replaced states by work queue (using states get complex even with a few states)
  - I am learning Swift every day and [refactor code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_refactoring) is important
- code ([master](https://github.com/rsyncOSX/Version3.x/tree/master)) at Github is updated with last commits
