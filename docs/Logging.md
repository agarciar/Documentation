## Logging

Index of [RsyncOSX documentation](https://rsyncosx.github.io/Documentation/).

Detailed logging in RsyncOSX might be switched on/off in user configuration. Only **backup** tasks are logged. All loggdata is by default listed in table within Logs view (sorted by date). Loggdata can be _filtered_ by text search in:

- **Server** (remote server)
- **Catalog** (local catalog)
- **Date**

Loggdata is filtered by one of the three subjects depended upon which radio button is on. Cancel search field reloads all loggdata.
