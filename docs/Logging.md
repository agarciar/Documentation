## Logging

Index of [RsyncOSX documentation](https://rsyncosx.github.io/Documentation/).

Detailed logging in RsyncOSX might be switched on/off in userconfiguration. Only **backup** tasks are logged. All logdata is by default listed in table within Logs view (sorted by date). Logdata can be _filtered_ by textsearch in:


- **Server** (remote server)
- **Catalog** (local catalog)
- **Date**

There are two ways to filter logdata by search field. If a row is selected logdate is filtered by one of the three subjects depended upon which radiobutton is on. 

If no row is selected, text can be entered in search field and by selecting one of the radiobuttons logdata is filtered by matching text and subject by radiobutton. Cancel search field reloads all loggdata. 

All logdata is by default listed in table.
